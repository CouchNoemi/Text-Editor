# Text-Editor

I  built a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria.it features a number of data and persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application  also functions offline.
Used an IndexedDB database.The package is called `idb`, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
This app Creates notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
